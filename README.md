Bethelsolv Standalone Calculator
Overview
Bethelsolv is a powerful, standalone web application that combines a Real Analysis tool and a Scientific Calculator into a single, intuitive interface. This application is built as a single HTML file, leveraging the simplicity of CDN-hosted libraries for React and Math.js, making it highly portable and easy to use. The design is fully responsive, ensuring it works seamlessly across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

Features
Real Analysis Functionality:

Limits: Compute the limit of a function as x approaches a specific point.

Continuity: Check if a function is continuous at a given point, with a detailed breakdown of the three conditions for continuity.

Differentiability: Test if a function is differentiable at a point.

Graph Plotting: Visualize the function's curve in real-time. The graph highlights key points and behaviors related to the analysis, such as discontinuities or limits.

Scientific Calculator: A full-featured scientific calculator for performing complex mathematical operations, including trigonometric functions, logarithms, and powers.

Detailed Solutions: After each analysis computation, a comprehensive, step-by-step solution is generated to explain the result and the mathematical principles behind it.

Interactive UI: A clean, modern user interface built with Tailwind CSS. The app features a tab-based navigation system to switch between the Real Analysis and Scientific Calculator modules.

Robust Error Handling: The application includes specific error messages for invalid function syntax, preventing common issues and guiding the user to correct their input.

How to Use
Simply open the index.html file in any modern web browser. No installation or build steps are required.

Real Analysis
Navigate to the "Real Analysis" tab.

Select the analysis type: Limits, Continuity, or Differentiability.

Enter your function in the "Function f(x):" input field (e.g., x^2, sin(x)).

Enter the point of interest in the "Point a:" input field (e.g., 0, 1).

Click the Compute button.

The result, a detailed solution, and a corresponding graph will appear.

Scientific Calculator
Switch to the "Scientific" tab.

Use the on-screen buttons to enter your expression.

Press the = button to evaluate the expression.

Use the C button to clear the input.

Code Structure
This entire application is contained within a single index.html file, following the principle of a standalone web app.

HTML: The core structure of the page, including the div for the React application and the canvas for plotting.

Tailwind CSS: Loaded via a CDN to provide a modern, utility-first styling framework without the need for a separate stylesheet.

React: Loaded via CDNs, allowing for a component-based, state-driven UI. The application logic is written in a single React App component within a <script type="text/babel"> tag.

Babel Standalone: This CDN allows the browser to directly interpret the JSX and modern JavaScript syntax used in the React component.

Math.js: A powerful mathematical library loaded via a CDN, used for parsing function expressions, performing symbolic differentiation, and evaluating expressions.

Dependencies
React v18

ReactDOM v18

Babel Standalone v6

Math.js v12.4.1

Tailwind CSS (via CDN)

Google Fonts (Inter)

Error Handling
The application includes specific, user-friendly error handling to improve the experience.

Syntax Errors: If an invalid function is entered (e.g., x/, sin), the application catches the error and displays a clear message like "Invalid input. Please ensure your function is a complete and valid expression of x...".

Plotting Errors: The graph plotting function is isolated within a try...catch block. If an issue occurs during plotting (e.g., the function produces infinite values), the canvas is cleared, and an error message is shown instead of crashing the app.

Math.js Availability: A check is performed to ensure the Math.js library is loaded before any computations begin.
